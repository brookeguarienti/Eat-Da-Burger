### How to use the app
The user will enter whatever type of burger they would like to order. 

Once they select "Place Order", the user will see their order being moved to the "Burgers" column.

The user will see that there is a "Devour it!" button next to their burger.

Once ready, the user will click the "Devour it!" button. 

The user should then see their burger selection move to the "Devoured" column.
